            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The essential story told by my portfolio site is that of a an experienced game designer in 2034 who has created impressive interactive experiences and games across multiple platforms. The portfolio showcases not only the projects I wish I would have completed by then, but also my journey through emerging technologies and innovative design processes. The audience I am addressing includes potential employers, collaborators, and perhaps most importantly, aspiring game developers looking for inspiration. The website uses a simple, minimalistic but modern structure, focusing on accessibility and ease of navigation.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong><a href="https://joanx.com/">Joan – Interactive Artist:</a></strong> What I liked and inspired me the most is the responsive icons on her page and her simple navigation bar.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://victoiredouy.com/">Victoire Douy – Illustrator:</a></strong> What I liked and inspired me the most is the minimalistic, responsive and nice UI; we see just the minimal that we need to see and nothing more, unless we want to see more.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://withad.am/">Adam Sandoval – Web Designer:</a></strong> This one also inspired me greatly. I liked the way he uses the mouse over and cursor appearance. He also presents himself so well on his about page.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alt Text for Images</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Text Resize or Font Resizing:</strong>This feature helps users with visual impairments by allowing them to adjust the font size for better readability. It is accessed when the user clicks on the accessibility icon on the navigation bar.</li>
                <li><strong>High Contrast:</strong> As per the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for the contrast ratios, the contrast ratio between my background color #EBBDB5 and #000000 font is 7.19:1, which meets WCAG AA standards for both normal and large text.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsive Design</li>
                <li>Intuitive Navigation</li>
                <li>Load Speed Optimization</li>

            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CSS Grid:</strong>I was adamant to learn this layout style because initially it was confusing especially when compared to the simple flex method, but with the use of a good book, I have mastered this layout style.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Event Handling:</strong>I learned JavaScript for the first time in this course. Event handling is one of the aspects of JS that I am the most proud of.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility Guidelines:</strong>I spend a long time reading about the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), I became fascinated by how much web developers can actually help users with disabilities take the most of the web, but sadly this area is usually ignored by most web developers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
            <p>Aspects that were particularly successful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Consistency:</strong>I took time to ensure that the website design is consistent which was difficult because I had to apply same code to every page, but it turned out to be one success to be highlighted on this learning journey.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Behavior:</strong>Even though, I chose to go with a minimalistic style, I also wanted to be as responsive as the inspiring websites I used were. It was trial and error, but since I had a good knowledge of JS, I figured a way to do anything I had in mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong>I wanted the works page to look appealing to a fellow game developer or enthousiast, so I gave it a game-like theme where the user has to interact with a picture to find out about the work. It was a great success.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
